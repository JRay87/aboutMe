    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p> My name is John R. I was born way back in 1987 to two American military members stationed in England. I was only 4 months old when we moved back to the US so I didn't get the sweet british accent, but I'm not allowed to give blood, so it's not all bad. We moved around a lot and I went to 8 different schools before college and I carried on that tradition, attending multiple universities before graduating with my Bachelor's in 2021.

    I served in the Air Force for six years and have three combat deployments. After I got out of the military I moved to Louisiana. I adopted my dog, Vinny, from a shelter there and that dog and I have put more miles on my car than some people see in their life. We drove up to New York so I could visit my family and go see the Mets play. Then I packed the car back up (Vinny kept finding excuses not to help) and drove out west for blue skies and greener pastures.

    I have very little prior software development experience, but I am excited for this opportunity. My goal is to excel within this new field.
