      <p id="pIntro"> My name is John R. I was born way back in 1987 to two American military members stationed in England. I was only 4 months old when we moved back to the US so I didn't get the sweet british accent, but I'm not allowed to give blood, so it's not all bad. We moved around a lot and I went to 8 different schools before college and I carried on that tradition, attending multiple universities before graduating with my Bachelor's in 2021.</p>
